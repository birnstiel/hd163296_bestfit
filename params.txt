 

 
Parameters used in the fitting of the  parametric model of the radial profile of the dust for the HD163296 systen, by Isella et al, 2016. 

A linear grid from 1 to 500 AU has been used.  Snapshot taken at t = 4.67 Myr.  Other Parametes used:


alpha = 1e-3

Mstar = 2.3* M_sun

Vfrag = 2e3 cm/s


Temperature profile:


T = 24 * (r/100AU ) ^-0.6


Initial surface density :

gamma = 0.2

rc = 100 AU

M_gas/Mstar = 0.004


Planet params:

Mp1 = 1 M_jup

Rp1 = 56 AU

Mp2 =  1_M_jup

Rp2 = 83 AU

Mp3 = 0.9 M_jup

Rp3 = 125 AU


delay time (from respect to the most inner planet)

tp2 =  2.2 Myr

tp3 = 1.75 Myr



Convolution using FWHM of 0.22''
