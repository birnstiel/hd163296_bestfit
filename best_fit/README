 

  
Best fit of the parametric model of the  radial profile of the dust, by Isella et al, 2016 . Obtained using the dustpy code, a python version of the  disk evolution code by Birnstiel et al,2010 



Best_fit_RicciOp . From left to right, contains:

[0] -->  Radial position in  arcsec

[1] -->  Intensity flux  obtained in the simulation  in  [erg/cm^2/Hz/Sr]

[2} --> Isella profile  in  [erg/cm^2/Hz/Sr]) 




Best_fit_RicciOp_nonConvoluted . From left to right, contains:

[0] -->  Radial position in  arcsec for the non convoluted simulation ([1])

[1] -->  Intensity flux  obtained in the simulation , in  [erg/cm^2/Hz/Sr]

[2] --> Radial position for the non convoluted profile ([3])

[3} --> Non convoluted  profile, in [erg/cm^2/Hz/Sr])
